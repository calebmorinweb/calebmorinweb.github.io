I built this furnace primarily to melt aluminum, however it will also melt copper, with limited success melting cast iron. The steel drum used as a form is from a repurposed dryer bin, and the refractory is a homemade mix made of sand, portland cement, perlite, and plaster of paris. The furnace burns used motor oil, with forced air being provided by a leaf blower.
